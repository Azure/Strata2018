# Visualizing Word Embeddings on TensorBoard

The directory [`movies_tb`](./movies_tb/) contains two tab separated files that contain embeddings for movie plots and metadata about the movie genre. You can upload the two files to the online [tensorboard viewer](http://projector.tensorflow.org/) to view the embeddings in an interactive visualization.
