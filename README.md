# Strata 2018 Tutorial on Using R and Python for Scalable Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI

Accessed via R and Python APIs, pre-trained Deep Learning models and Transfer Learning are making custom Image Classification with large or small amounts of labeled data easily accessible to data scientists and application developers. This tutorial walks you through creating end-to-end data science solutions in R and Python on virtual machines, Spark environments, and cloud-based infrastructure and consuming them in production. This tutorial covers strategies and best practices for porting and interoperating between R and Python, with a novel Deep Learning use case for Image Classification as an example use case.

The tutorial materials and the scripts that are used to create the virtual machines configured as single-node Spark clusters are published in this GitHub repository, so youâ€™ll be able to create environments identical to the ones you use in the tutorial by running the scripts  after the tutorial session completes.

Outline:

1.	What limits the scalability of R and Python scripts?
2.	What functions and techniques can be used to overcome those limits?
3.	Hands-on, end-to-end Deep Learning-based Image Classification example in R and Python using functions that scale from single nodes to distributed computing clusters
    1.	Data exploration and wrangling
    2.	Featurization and Modeling
    3.	Deployment and Consumption
    4.	Scaling with distributed computing
